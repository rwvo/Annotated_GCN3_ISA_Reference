## Annotated GCN3 reference guide

Based on revision 1.1 at http://amd-dev.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wordpress/media/2013/12/AMD_GCN3_Instruction_Set_Architecture_rev1.1.pdf.

In red: annotations regarding anything that is unclear to me, or that I think is incorrect.

In green: tangential questions/remarks that probably don't require correction or clarification in the text, such as
"How do we access the GDS from a C++ lambda?"
